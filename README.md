# Resale-Flat-Machine-Learning-Project
Machine learning project to predict future flat resale prices using SciKit Learn library  

This project aims to predict future flat resale prices.  
The original datasets can be found here https://data.gov.sg/collections/189/view

The data is first processed in "EDA and Data Processing.ipynb" and saved as .pkl files.  
The processed data is then fed into multiple machine learning models in each .ipynv files.
